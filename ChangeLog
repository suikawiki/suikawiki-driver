	* sw.cgi: The code to generate HTML headers and body element
	container itself is moved from |convert_swml_to_html| to the main
	code.  Insert an "edit" link to the HTML document.  Page-edit
	feature implemented.
	(get_page_url): "/" was not converted to "+".
	(get_xml_data): Lock before accessing to the cache.  Save the hash
	of the cached copy of the source text and check whether the cache
	is up to date before returning a cached copy.
	(get_hash): New function.
	(convert_sw3_page): Lock the id before new copy is stored, to
	avoid race condition (access by id before the end of convertion).

	* mksw3list: Don't replace namespace separator '//' by a space,
	for compatibility with existing WikiNames that contains '//' as
	part of semantic name, e.g. 'http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml';

	* sw.cgi (get_page_url): No longer split name by '//'.  Normalize
	white space in the name.
